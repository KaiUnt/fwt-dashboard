FWT Dashboard User Manual

Hello and welcome to the FWT Dashboard – the ultimate tool for commentators!
Here you'll find everything you need to deliver professional and engaging commentary for FWT events.
The dashboard provides all the information about the athletes participating in each event, neatly sorted by start list. You can explore all results, view the performance history of riders over the years, and access event history to see how athletes performed at the same venue in the past. You also get an overview of the FWT Series Rankings – all in one place.
Additionally, you can store individual notes and information about riders, and even share them with your colleagues through the Friends system.
Every new user starts with 5 credits. If you need more, simply reach out to kai@open-faces.com.
To get familiar with the tool, you can also explore past events – they are free to view, so you can try out all features with full data.
Enjoy using the dashboard, and I’d love to hear your feedback!
Together, we can continue improving this tool for everyone.

The Basics

 
1.	Languages
On the start page, you can adjust the interface language to your needs. Supported languages are German, English, and French.
2.	Credits
Every new user automatically receives 5 credits to start with. You need these credits to unlock events. If you require more credits, simply contact kai@open-faces.com.
3.	Profile Settings
In your user settings, you can edit your personal information such as password, username, and organization.
4.	Friends
The Friends feature allows you to connect with colleagues and share commentator information. To add a colleague, you need their exact username. Enter it and send a request — once accepted, you can exchange information.
5.	Managing Credits
Credit management serves as a safeguard to prevent unlimited event downloads. If you need additional credits for your work, please contact kai@open-faces.com.
 
The Event Section

 
1.	Refresh
The Refresh button lets you reload event data if needed. In practice, this feature is rarely necessary, as updates usually occur automatically.
2.	Show All Events
This option displays past events that you can view for free. This is especially useful when there are no active live events, allowing you to explore all features and get familiar with the system.
3.	Multi-Event Mode
The Multi-Event Mode is designed for cases where two events take place simultaneously at the same venue — for example, when Junior and Qualifier runs are held in parallel with alternating bib numbers. Both events are shown side by side and sorted by bib number. Make sure the bib numbers are correctly configured in Liveheats.
4.	Select Event
To access an event, simply click on its event card. This consumes one credit, but once unlocked, the event remains permanently available to you. You can revisit it anytime without using more credits.
5.	Search Field
The search bar allows you to quickly find events by name or location.
 
The Event Dashboard

 
1.	Start List
The start list displays all athletes in their running order. You can immediately see who’s up next and prepare for commentary. The order only works if it is defined in Liveheats. You can search by name or nation, and a summary is shown at the bottom.
 

2.	Refresh and Save Offline
The 'Refresh and Save Offline' button lets you update the event and simultaneously store it for offline use — ideal for locations with poor internet connectivity.
3.	Rider Info
In the Rider Info section, you’ll find detailed information on each athlete — including personal data, nationality, and current rankings — helping you deliver professional commentary.
4.	Commentator Info
Here, you can save personal notes and information about each rider that are important for your commentary. Use the Edit button to open a modal window where you can write and save your notes. These notes are private but can be shared with your friends (other commentators). You can also import information via CSV — ensure that first and last names are in columns 1 and 2.
  
 
5.	Event History
The Event History shows all past competitions at this venue or within this series. This allows you to quickly check how athletes performed previously and make historical comparisons.
 
6.	Performance History
The Performance Curve visualizes an athlete’s performance development over time — letting you see at a glance whether a rider is improving or declining.
7.	All Results
The All Results section provides an overview of all results for the event. By clicking Series Rankings, you can view the full ranking across all events — perfect for placing current results in overall context.
 
 
8.	FWT Series Ranking
The FWT Series Rankings button takes you to a new page where you can view all season rankings.
